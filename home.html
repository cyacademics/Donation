    Mission:
</h2>
<p>
 To contribute towards the problem of shortage of blood in India by raising awareness and improving donor experience and thereby, become a 360-degree solution provider.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>
    How we started:
  </h2>  
<p>We at BloodConnect live by the motto of saving lives by ensuring every drop of blood contributes towards the right cause of saving lives. A mission started by young IITians (Delhi), BloodConnect commenced operations on 1st April 2010 as a project under National Service Scheme (NSS) chapter. Soon, the young team lived by the fact that blood cant be manufactured in factories and committed themselves towards connecting generous donors to the donees.

    They worked around-the-clock towards this cause, and in no time, BloodConnect became a full- scale NGO with a mission of solving the problem of blood shortage in India. The organization now caters to any requirement pertaining to blood and by uniting people in need of blood to voluntary blood donors.
   </p> 
   <br><br>
<h2>
    Our activities:
</h2>

<p>    Since its inception, BloodConnect has developed a 360-degree solution to cater to the problem of blood shortage in the country. The model revolves around four focal points:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensuring continuous, sufficient blood supply to blood banks through blood donation camps and weekly donations
    </li>
    <li>
        Helping those in dire need by operating an emergency 24x7 helpline

    </li>
    <li>
        Increasing awareness by organizing Street Plays, Info-Talks, Competitions

    </li>
    <li>
        Establishing a network of youth across the country to lead the movement

    </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>
    Our partners
</h2>
  <p>  Many corporates have come forward to help us in this cause by providing their expertise and resources.
<br>
They partner for quarterly blood donation camps, provide monetary support via payroll donation, and even provide mentorship to our team via volunteers.
<br>
Also Being largely student volunteer driven, colleges are the backbone of our organization. With our college partners, we are able to organize seamless blood donation camps throughout the year, recruit the most motivated, sharp and hardworking volunteers and last, but most importantly, motivate the newly 18, the first time donors to become regular lifesavers.
